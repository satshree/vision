For the first version, Vision was built on Electron.js and plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript with Python. In this second version, the UI of Vision is developed using React.js and the Python files have been compiled into Microsoft Windows Executable Binaries. This introduces more stable and fluent UI with no necessity of installing Python dependencies on user's system.

## Usage
Vision provides you with two options to scan network,
  
1. <b>Default Scan</b>: On starting Vision, press on "Let Vision Do The Dirty Work". Your network will be scanned until Vision finds two empty subnets.  
2. <b>Custom Scan</b>: On starting Vision, press on "Scan The Network Yourself". Here, Vision will let you scan a range of IP addresses or a single IP address.  
  
Once the scanning is done, all the hosts will be listed on graphical view and tabular view. The graph represents total number of devices grouped by their manufacturers. From tabular view, you can perform port scanning or OS fingerprinting on individual hosts. You can also save the scanned hosts as CSV file. Vision will save the file on your Desktop.  
  
3. <b>Other Options</b>: With this new version, you can probe about any device on the internet as long as you know their public IP or domain name. Along with this, you can also import previously saved results to visualize and list out the devices scanned at that moment. However, you cannot perform any further actions on imported data.  

## Development
Vision is now built on Electron.js - React.js - Python.   
  
Points to note to run Vision for development.

  - The main Electron.js config is in 'public' directory. However, electron-builder also requires the js file named 'electron.js' in 'build' directory to compile. 
 
  - Update the 'loadURL' value in 'electron.js' to localhost URL.  

  - Make sure to update the path to backend scripts  in 'electron.js' if you are using different scripts.  

  - Make sure to check the loadURL value in 'electron.js'.
